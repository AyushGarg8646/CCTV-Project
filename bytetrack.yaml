# Default Ultralytics settings for ByteTrack tracker when using mode="track"
# For documentation and examples see https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/track/
# For ByteTrack source code see https://github.com/ifzhang/ByteTrack

# tracker_type: bytetrack # tracker type, ['botsort', 'bytetrack']
# track_high_thresh: 0.35 # threshold for the first association
# track_low_thresh: 0.1 # threshold for the second association
# new_track_thresh: 0.35 # threshold for init new track if the detection does not match any tracks
# track_buffer: 90 # buffer to calculate the time when to remove tracks
# match_thresh: 0.7 # threshold for matching tracks
# fuse_score: False # Whether to fuse confidence scores with the iou distances before matching
# min_box_area: 100  # threshold for min box areas(for tracker evaluation, not used for now)
# tracker_type: bytetrack

# # Detection association thresholds
# track_high_thresh: 0.35     # ↑ slightly higher for stable initial matches
# track_low_thresh: 0.1     # ↓ low enough to recover tracks after missed frames
# new_track_thresh: 0.35      # ↑ avoid false new IDs from weak detections

# # Persistence and re-identification
# track_buffer: 60           # ↑ keep tracks alive longer (good for occlusion recovery)
# match_thresh: 0.7       # ↑ require higher IoU to match detections before relying on ReID
# fuse_score: False           # Let FastReID handle matching, not confidence fusion

# # Optional stability tweaks
# min_box_area: 100           # Ignore tiny false detections in CCTV
# mot20: False               # Adjusts internal matching for crowded scenes



tracker_type: bytetrack        # Keep ByteTrack as tracker
track_high_thresh: 0.5         # Stricter first association, only confident matches
track_low_thresh: 0.1          # Keep low for secondary association
new_track_thresh: 0.6          # Require higher confidence to start a new track, avoid unnecessary IDs
track_buffer: 150              # Keep tracks alive longer (good for CCTV gaps)
match_thresh: 0.85              # Increase match threshold for tighter IoU matching
fuse_score: False              # Let FastReID handle identity matching, no score fusion
min_box_area: 800               # Ignore small noisy boxes (CCTV often produces tiny false positives)
